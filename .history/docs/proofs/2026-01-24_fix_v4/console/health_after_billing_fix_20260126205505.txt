{"status":"error","code":502,"message":"Application failed to respond","request_id":"r_QeaEjeRG-j8l8Hc9o55Q"}

Note: Checked at ~5 minutes after billing.js fix deployment. Still 502.

Fixes applied so far:
1. Fixed duplicate PORT declaration (SyntaxError)
2. Fixed missing routes/support.js module (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND)
3. Fixed missing catch block in routes/billing.js (SyntaxError: Missing catch or finally after try)

Backend still 502 means there is ANOTHER runtime error.
User needs to provide the next fatal error from Railway logs.
