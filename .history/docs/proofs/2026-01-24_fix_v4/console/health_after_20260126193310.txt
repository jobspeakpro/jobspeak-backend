{"status":"error","code":502,"message":"Application failed to respond","request_id":"i1lZ-JXmRMuJFtzxozsQ6Q"}

Note: Checked at ~3 minutes after deployment push. Still 502.
This indicates either:
1. Deployment is still building/starting (Railway can take 3-5 minutes)
2. There is another runtime error after the PORT fix
3. The application is crashing on startup for a different reason

User should check Railway deployment logs for the latest build status.
